As of now Rules 1-23 are done. These include functions more_defines, define, stmt_list, stmt, literal, 
quoted_lit, more_tokens,param_list, else_part, stmt_pair, and stmt_pair_body. Start working through 
action and any_other_token.

Within each of the functions there are else-statements that cout error messages. For checkpoint 1,
error checking should not be included, so when everything compiles properly comment these out.

I skipped lambda rules because I wasn't sure at the time what to input, so go back to any function that 
has a lambda rule and make the proper adjustments.
